- Do not enumerate over all combinations of E_r, only pick one for every component (DRAM/CPU/GPU/storage...)
- Find part number from SuperCloud, then look up online for the manufacturing process, then map it to one E_r number in the ACT listing.

- When determining the carbon intensity of the fab, use coal for Intel and Taiwan TSMC
- Ask question whenever you have them, don't wait till the next weekly sync
- Continuously push update whenever you have some progress, don't wait till you have finished everything then push the update
- Will have the full embodied carbon model early next week

## 11/9/2022

- cancelled due to SoCC

## 11/16/2022

- Processor carbon estimation is done
- Memory and storage estimation needs input from SuperCloud. Sent email to Sid.

## 11/23/2022

- Canceled, communicating over slack

## 11/30/2022

- Peter is almost done with carbon footprint modeling, remaining: number of parts in SuperCloud, and GPU memory footprint
- Peter will work on a presentation, possible in the week 12/12-12/16

## 12/14/2022

- Peter presented the embodied carbon footprint
- In summary: 
  - System has very high packaging overhead due to the DRAM
  - Storage and DRAM becomes the major component for embodied carbon footprint. Suprisingly it is not the powerful GPU.
- Peter will summarize the findings in SuperCloud, and compare against the findings in ACT paper.
