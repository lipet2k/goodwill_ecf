- Do not enumerate over all combinations of E_r, only pick one for every component (DRAM/CPU/GPU/storage...)
- Find part number from SuperCloud, then look up online for the manufacturing process, then map it to one E_r number in the ACT listing.

- When determining the carbon intensity of the fab, use coal for Intel and Taiwan TSMC
- Ask question whenever you have them, don't wait till the next weekly sync
- Continuously push update whenever you have some progress, don't wait till you have finished everything then push the update
- Will have the full embodied carbon model early next week
